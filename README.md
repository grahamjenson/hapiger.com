#### Install HapiGER

Install with `npm`

```bash
npm install -g hapiger
```

<br/>
***

#### Start HapiGER

By default it will start with an in-memory event store (events are not persisted)

```bash
hapiger
```

*There are also PostgreSQL and RethinkDB event stores for persistence and scaling*

<br/>
***

#### Give an Action Weight

Set the `view` action to have weight `1`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/default/actions' -d'{
    "name": "view", 
    "weight": 1
  }'
```

<br/>
***

#### Create some Events

`Alice` `view`s `Harry Potter` 

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/default/events' -d '{
    "person":"Alice", 
    "action": "view", 
    "thing":"Harry Potter"
  }' 
```

Then, `Bob` also `view`s `Harry Potter` (now `Bob` has similar viewing habits to `Alice`)

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/default/events' -d '{
    "person":"Bob", 
    "action": "view", 
    "thing":"Harry Potter"
  }'
```

`Bob` then `buy`s `The Hobbit`

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/default/events' -d '{
    "person":"Bob", 
    "action": "buy", 
    "thing":"The Hobbit"
  }'
```

<br/>
***

#### Get Recommendations

What books should `Alice` `buy`?

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3456/default/recommendations?person=Alice&action=buy'
```

```
{
  "recommendations":[
    {
      "thing":"The Hobbit",
      "weight":0.22119921692859512,
      "people":[
        "Bob"
      ],
      "last_actioned_at":"2015-02-05T05:56:42.862Z"
    }
  ],
  "confidence":0.00019020140391302825,
  "similar_people":{
    "Bob":1
  }
}
```

`Alice` should buy `The Hobbit` as it was recommended by `Bob` with a weight of about `0.2`.

*The `confidence` of these recommendations is pretty low because there are not many events in the system*

<br/>

#### How HapiGER Works (the Quick Version)

The HapiGER API calculates recommendations for `Alice` to `buy` by:

1. Finding people that are like `Alice` by looking at her past events
2. Calculating the similarities between `Alice` and those people
3. Look at the recent `things` that those similar people `buy`
4. Weight those `thing`s using the similarity of the people

#### Event Stores

The "in-memory" memory event store is the default, this will not scale well or persist event so is not recommended for production. 

The **recommended** event store is **PostgreSQL**, which can be used with:

```
hapiger --es pg --esoptions '{
    "connection":"postgres://localhost/hapiger"
  }'  
```

*Options are passed to [knex](http://knexjs.org/).*

HapiGER also supports a [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/) event store:

```
hapiger --es rethinkdb --esoptions '{
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port": 28015,
    "db":"hapiger"
  }'
```

*Options passed to [rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash).*

<br/>
***

#### Compacting the Event Store

The event store needs to be regularly maintained by removing old, outdated, or superfluous events; this is called **compacting**. This can be done either synchronously or asynchronously (it can take a while):

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/default/compact'
```

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/default/compact_async'
```

<br/>
***

#### Namespaces

Namespaces are used to separate events for different applications or categories of things. The default namespace is `default`, but you can create namespaces by:

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/namespace' -d'{
    "namespace": "newnamespace"
  }'  
```

To delete a namespace (**and all its events!**):

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:3456/namespace/movies'
```

<br/>
***

#### Configuration of HapiGER

There are many configuration variables for HapiGER to tune the generated recommendations, these can be viewed with `hapiger --help`. The impact of each of these options are described in [the long version](http://www.maori.geek.nz/post/how_ger_generates_recommendations_the_anatomy_of_a_recommendations_engine) of how HapiGER works.
