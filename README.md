#### Install HapiGER

Install with `npm`

```bash
npm install -g hapiger
```

<br/>
***

#### Start HapiGER

By default it will start with an in-memory event store (events are not persisted)

```bash
hapiger
```

*There are also PostgreSQL and RethinkDB event stores for persistence and scaling*

<br/>
***

#### Create a Namespace

The first thing to do is to create a namespace, which is a bucket that person events are put into:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/namespaces' -d'{
    "namespace": "movies"
  }'
```

<br/>
***

#### Create some Events

An event occurs when a person actions something, e.g. `Alice` `view`s `Harry Potter`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/events' -d '{
    "events": [
    {
      "namespace": "movies",
      "person":    "Alice",
      "action":    "view",
      "thing":     "Harry Potter"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Then, `Bob` also `view`s `Harry Potter` (now `Bob` has similar viewing habits to `Alice`)

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/events' -d '{
    "events": [
    {
      "namespace": "movies",
      "person":    "Bob",
      "action":    "view",
      "thing":     "Harry Potter"
    }
  ]
}'
```

When a person actions and thing, it serves two purposes in HapiGER:

1. It is used to measure a persons similarity to other people
2. It can be a recommendation of that thing

For example, when `Bob` `buy`s `LOTR`

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/events' -d '{
    "events": [
    {
      "namespace":  "movies",
      "person":     "Bob",
      "action":     "buy",
      "thing":      "LOTR",
      "expires_at": "2016-10-12"
    }
  ]
}'
```

This is an action that can be used to find similar people **AND** it can be seen as `Bob` recommending  `LOTR`. For an event to be a recommendation as well it must have an expiration date set with `expires_at`, which is how long the recommendation will be available for.

<br/>
***

#### Recommendations

Recommendations can be generated by either passing the name of a `person` or a `thing`, the `namespace` to generate recommendations from, and a `configuration` which defines how to search for recommendations. The `configuration` is passed to GER and the available variables are listed in the [GER Documentation](https://github.com/grahamjenson/ger).

What movies should we recommend `Alice`?

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/recommendations' -d '{
    "namespace": "movies",
    "person": "Alice",
    "configuration": {
      "actions" : {"view": 5, "buy": 10}
    }
}'
```

will return:

```
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "thing": "LOTR",
      "weight": 0.44721359549996,
      "last_actioned_at": "2015-10-12T17:04:14+01:00",
      "last_expires_at": "2016-10-12T01:00:00+01:00",
      "people": [
        "Bob"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "neighbourhood": {
    "Bob": 0.44721359549996,
    "Alice": 1
  },
  "confidence": 0.00036398962692384
}
```

`Alice` should buy `LOTR` as it was recommended by `Bob` with a weight of about `0.4`.

<br/>

What movies should we recommend to someone looking at `Harry Potter`?

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/recommendations' -d '{
    "namespace": "movies",
    "thing": "Harry Potter",
    "configuration": {
      "actions" : {"view": 5, "buy": 10}
    }
}'
```

returns

```
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "thing": "LOTR",
      "weight": 0.70710678118655,
      "last_actioned_at": "2015-10-13T08:53:00.885Z",
      "last_expires_at": "2016-10-12T00:00:00.000Z",
      "people": [
        "Bob"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "neighbourhood": {
    "LOTR": 0.70710678118655
  },
  "confidence": 0.0010667601060058
}
```

The person should buy `LOTR` as it was recommended by `Bob` with a weight of about `0.7`.

*The `confidence` of these recommendations is low because there are not many events in the system. As you add events the confidence will increase*

<br/>
***

#### Event Stores

The "in-memory" memory event store is the default, this will not scale well or persist event so is not recommended for production.

The **recommended** event store is **PostgreSQL**, which can be used with:

```
hapiger --es pg --esoptions '{
    "connection":"postgres://localhost/hapiger"
  }'
```

*Options are passed to [knex](http://knexjs.org/).*

HapiGER also supports a [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/) event store:

```
hapiger --es rethinkdb --esoptions '{
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port": 28015,
    "db":"hapiger"
  }'
```

*Options passed to [rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash).*

<br/>
***

#### Compacting the Event Store

The event store needs to be regularly maintained by removing old, outdated, or superfluous events; this is called **compacting**

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/compact' -d '{
  "namespace": "movies"
}'
```

<br/>
***

#### Namespaces

Namespaces are used to separate events for different applications or categories of things. You can create namespaces by:

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3456/namespace' -d'{
    "namespace": "newnamespace"
  }'
```

To delete a namespace (**and all its events!**):

```
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:3456/namespace/movies'
```
